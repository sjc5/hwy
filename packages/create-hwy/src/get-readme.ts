## IMPORTANT DENO-SPECIFIC NOTES:

Here is our recommended way to use Deno with Hwy:

1. Use \`npm install\` (adjusted for your package manager) to install dependencies.
2. Run \`deno task dev\` to start the dev server.
3. Use the \`npm:\` prefix when importing modules (whether in a source file or in an import map).
This template does import mapping via the "imports" property in \`deno.json\`. This is what
makes the usage of bare specifiers in the source files work.

const deno_tailwind_add_on = `
To use Tailwind with Deno locally, you will need to either run \`npm i -g tailwindcss\` or
set up the [Standalone Tailwind CLI](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/standalone-cli).
`.trim();

const deno_deploy_add_on = `
To deploy on Deno Deploy, you should follow the setup instructions within Deno Deploy
to get a GitHub Actions build step set up. You can use the standard
\`.github/workflows/deploy.yml\` file that is created for you during that setup. 
All you will need to do is update the entrypoint (near the bottom of the yaml file)
to point to \`dist/entry.server.js\`.

## IMPORTANT WRANGLER-SPECIFIC NOTES:

Because Wrangler is in charge of your dev server, you should set your dev server port
via the \`--port\` flag in the \`dev:wrangler\` script in your \`package.json\` file
instead of in the \`dev.port\` field in your \`hwy.config.ts\` file.

When you deploy, you'll want to set your build configuration as follows:

- Build command: \`npm run build\`
- Build output directory: \`/dist\`

Additionally, you'll need to set the \`nodejs_compat\` compatibility flags for both
Production and Preview from the Cloudflare dashboard. [Read more](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions/get-started/#runtime-features).
